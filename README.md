Since the COVID-19 was recognized as a global issue, several works about the topic emerged. One of the concentration area is about abnormalities detection in Chest X-Ray and Computer Tomography (CT) images with several approaches. Basically, many works only uses deep learning techniques for predicting COVID-19. However, the results of these algorithms could be improved with image preprocessing, before using as input in a deep learning algorithm. This work intends to compare the performance of image processing techniques in the classification of Chest X-Ray images with/ without COVID-19. The image processing techniques includes image segmentation, intending to get the most important features of the image and neural networks for images, intending to classify the COVID-19/ NON COVID-19 image. As results the recall, precision and f1-score of the classification procedure shows the performance of each algorithm. This work shows the best techniques for COVID-19 detection.
